## Requirements

This is a BYOD (bring your own device) workshop and some software and accounts are required.

### Tasks

#### Install Visual Studio Code

We are using VS Code to write our code. It is a free, open-source editor with great extensibility.

[Download it here for free](https://code.visualstudio.com/download).

#### Install Code for IBM i and the Db2 for i extension

We are using the Code for IBM i extension to connect to IBM i systems, and then using the Db2 for IBM i extension to work with the database.

**After you have installed Visual Studio Code**, then go ahead and install the [Code for IBM i extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=HalcyonTechLtd.code-for-ibmi) and the [Db2 for IBM i extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=HalcyonTechLtd.vscode-db2i), or, to make life easier in the future, install the [IBM i Development pack](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=HalcyonTechLtd.ibm-i-development-pack) which contains those extensions and more.

#### Access to an IBM i

If you are doing this workshop as part of a hosted lab, then a user profile and system will be provided to you. If you're using your own system, then ensure SSH is running on your system. [Check out the requirements](../../).

## Goals

The main goal of this workshop is to understand how you can write IBM i code (be it RPGLE, COBOL, CL, etc) when storing source code inside of a git repository. This is made easy through some of the functionality provided in Code for IBM i (the extension) as part of Visual Studio Code.
