### Installation

For the workshop, you need to install the following:

* [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com)
* the [IBM i Development Pack extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=HalcyonTechLtd.ibm-i-development-pack) into VS Code

### Using an IBM i

For the workshop, you need an IBM i to connect to:

1. You can use your own 7.3+ IBM i server. SSH must be enabled - which is typical - but you can view the [requirements here](/docs/#requirements).
2. PUB400 is an option for users who cannot use their own server. [Sign up to PUB400 here](https://pub400.com/cgi/signup.nd/start).

### Starting the workshop

The workshop steps are actually viewed inside of Visual Studio Code. Open up Visual Studio Code, press <code>F1</code> and search 'open walkthrough'. Select 'Open Walkthrough...'
