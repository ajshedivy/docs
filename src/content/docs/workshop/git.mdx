4. Compiling your first program - folder structure, creating hello world, creating actions, conmpiling
5. Initialising your git repository - initialise git repo button in VS Code
6. Making additional changes - making commits into your repo
7. Making a public repository - making a public repository on GitHub from your repo

## Requirements

This is a BYOD (bring your own device) workshop and some software and accounts are required.

### Signup to GitHub

If you don't have a GitHub account, you are going to need one for this workshop. We will be creating new repositories and working with others.

[Sign up here](http://github.com/signup).

### Install GitHub Desktop

We will use GitHub Desktop to make cloning and working with git repositories easier. It is a great tool for beginners.

[Download it here for free](https://desktop.github.com).

**After you have installed GitHub Desktop**, launch GitHub Desktop and sign into your GitHub account. This will make working with GitHub repositories easier.

### Install Visual Studio Code

We are using VS Code to write our code. It is a free, open-source editor with great extensibility.

[Download it here for free](https://code.visualstudio.com/download).

### Install Code for IBM i

We are using the Code for IBM i extension to write, deploy and compile our RPGLE code. It is an extension that can be used for IBM i development in many ways.

**After you have installed Visual Studio Code**, then go ahead and install the [Code for IBM i extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=HalcyonTechLtd.code-for-ibmi), or, to make life easier in the future, install the [IBM i Development pack](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=HalcyonTechLtd.ibm-i-development-pack).

## Goals

The main goal of this workshop is to understand how you can write IBM i code (be it RPGLE, COBOL, CL, etc) when storing source code inside of a git repository. This is made easy through some of the functionality provided in Code for IBM i (the extension) as part of Visual Studio Code. GitHub Desktop is just a git client, which makes it easy for beginners to work with GitHub repositories.

### Terminology

Here are some common terms that you will read throughout this workshop.

| Term | Meaning |
| - | - |
| Repository | The place where files and history of those files are stored. |
| Clone | The act of 'copying' (literally cloning) the repository from another location. |
| Push | Pushing commits from one repository to another |
| Deploy | Moving files/sources from your local workspace to an IBM i server |
